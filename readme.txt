To convert existing subsites to layout managed subsites, move the .tcl and .adp files found
here to yoursite/www/admin (to guarantee only a main subsite admin can execute them).

Visit http://yoursite/admin/subsites.  A list of mounted instances of acs-subsite will
be displayed, with the option to convert to a layout managed subsite.  After converting,
restart AOLserver, and visit the subsite you've converted.  The layout manager wizard
will automatically start.
